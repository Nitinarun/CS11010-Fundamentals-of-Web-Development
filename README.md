This folder within my Github is a representation of the types of content I have learnt for my CS11010 Fundementals of Web Development module within my first year. 
The Files on this repository are the practicals that were conducted throughout Semester 2 whereby we had learnt a variety of skills and developed a deeper understanding
on the following topics within Web development :

. Explain the distinction between structure, content and presentation of web material and the benefits of maintaining that distinction.
. Write HTML and control its presentation using style sheets.
. Write client-side code to interact with the web page, read and process form content.
. Demonstrate an understanding of the difference between client-side and server-side, in the context of the web.
. Demonstrate an understanding of the importance of adhering to standards.
