    <p><u><b>So What is the point of this module ?</b></u>
        <br>This module essentially teaches us how to make a website using HTML5 and CSS. On top of this it will allow us to experiment and learn how to format our code and learn good coding practices when producing websites for future reference. So far in this module we have learned we have been learning the content through the lectures of how to navigate and use HTML5 code to produce a well designed and good looking website.
        <br>Using the information that we have learnt from the lectures and seminars, we apply the knowledge for our worksheets in the Practicals. To name a few things we have learnt, are knowing how to set the permissions of each HTML file we have within our M: drive, we have produced a digital CV that is linked in the menu above, learning the basics and detailed information of HTML & CSS language
        <br>
        <br>The parts of this module that I am fairly pleased with were the worksheets as I have had prior experience of learning HTML on my own hence it made it very easy to implement what I had already known from my pre-existing knowledge. However, the part I found difficult was integrating Javascript into HTML5.
